Give yourself about an hour for this test.

There are two projects in this solution: 

    FitsMe.Test.StackAndQueue - implementation project
    FitsMe.Test.StackAndQueue.UnitTests - unit test project

Within the Services folder in FitsMe.Test.StackAndQueue you will find two
classes, Stack and Queue.

Please implement a stack class and a queue class in these files, such that all
the unit tests in the test project will pass. Please do not use anything from
the following namespaces:

    - System.Collections
    - System.Collections.Generic
    - System.Linq

Also, please don't add any Nuget packages to the project.

Other than that, you may implement the two classes any way you see fit.

If you would like to include any notes about how you would change your
implementation if you had more time, memory considerations, performance
considerations, then please do so.
